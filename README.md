 Location-Based Road Proximity Service (Google Maps API)
📌 Project Overview

Distance Function is a Java-based cloud function that calculates the nearest main road for a given geographic location (latitude and longitude). It uses the Google Maps API to fetch nearby road data and compute the closest road accurately. The application is designed to run as a serverless service using Google Cloud Run / Google Cloud Functions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java 

Google Cloud Functions Framework

Google Maps Services API

Google Cloud Run

Maven

Gson (JSON parsing)

SLF4J (logging)
